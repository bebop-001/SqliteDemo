# SqliteDemo
This is a demo for using Sqlite with SqlOpenHelper.  It's based on 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDSVInZ2JCs">Shad Sluiter's "SQLite Database 
Tutorial for Android Studio"</a> on youtube but is written in Kotilin.  I took it quite a bit
further than Shad however.  I included a 'search window' and a spinner that allow selection
of the search type.  Search can be simple or you can use a complex SQL select statement.
I also include a default sql database in the assets directory which is copied into the
data base directory.
